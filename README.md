# ![](docs/images/Icon.svg) CRP XML Debugger

XML Debugger is an IntelliJ plugin that enables debugging of XML-based workflow languages executed in Java environments 
‚Äî such as Flowable, Camunda, and Activiti. It supports standards like BPMN and CMMN, with a default configuration tailored for Flowable. 

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. Install the plugin in Intellij IDEA,
2. Associate bpmn, cmmn (or any other xml based language file) with XSD extension.

3. Set a breakpoint in your BPMN or CMMN file ‚Äî for example, inside a <userTask> element:

![bpmn breakpoint](docs/images/bpmnBreakPoint.png)

If you run the bpmn process with JVM in the debug mode, the execution stops on the Activity behavior ready 
to execute the user task.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The plugin maps XML breakpoints to Java breakpoints with custom conditions.
When you set a breakpoint in XML, the plugin:
1. Locates the corresponding XML tag (e.g., <userTask>),
2. Creates a Java breakpoint in the target class and line,
3. Applies a dynamic Groovy expression as a breakpoint condition.

A sample configuration looks like this:
```json
{
      "xmlTag": "'userTask'.equals(xmlTag.name)",
      "className": "org.flowable.engine.impl.bpmn.behavior.UserTaskActivityBehavior",
      "lineNumber": 92,
      "condition": "'\"'+xmlTag.getAttribute('id').getValue() +'\".equals(execution.getActivityId()) && \"'+ xmlTag.getTreeParent().getAttribute('id').getValue()+ '\".equals(execution.getProcessDefinitionKey())'"
    }
```
`xmlTag` is a groovy condition for identifying `com.intellij.psi.xml.XmlTag` to which mapping is related to. 
`className` and `lineNumber` are identifying place where to put the java breakpoint. The condition is a
string groovy expression, which provides condition to set for given breakpoint. The condition expression from 
the previous code snippet is evaluated into:

```groovy
"task".equals(execution.getActivityId()) && "oneTaskProcess".equals(execution.getProcessDefinitionKey())
```

## üí° Benefits
1. Restores debugging capabilities for Flowable, which were removed from the open-source edition after version 7.0.0.
2. Works across multiple workflow engines ‚Äî Flowable, Camunda, and Activiti.
3. Does not alter runtime behavior (unlike Flowable Enterprise, which injects artificial wait states). 
4. Enables transparent, synchronized XML ‚Üî Java debugging.
